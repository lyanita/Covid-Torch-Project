# Torch Data and Analytics Recruiting Project 2021

## Overview
The [COVID Tracking Project][covid_homepage] is a volunteer organization 
that is dedicated to collecting and publishing data on COVID-19 testing and
patient outcomes. To better understand the current state of COVID-19 testing
in the US, we’d like you to create queries and documentation for the following
metrics:

- The total number of tests performed as of yesterday in the United States.
- The 7-day rolling average number of new cases per day rolling over the last 30 days.
- The 10 states with the highest test positivity rate (positive tests / tests
  performed) for tests performed in the last 30 days.

For each of the above, please provide:

- A SQL query that yields the desired metric
- A table that communicates the query results
- A brief description of the metric presented. Be sure to include any caveats 
  or context that should be communicated to stakeholders. 

## Details

We expect this exercise to take approximately two hours to complete. Keep in
mind that dates used in the query should be dynamic. You don’t need to worry
about the right SQL dialect, any is fine.
